    "Code Versioning\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the basics of code versioning using Git, a widely used version control system. Version control is essential for managing changes to your codebase, collaborating with others, and maintaining a history of your project. We'll cover the fundamental concepts of Git, how to perform common version control tasks, and best practices for organizing your code repository.\n",

    "1. What is Version Control? <a name=\"1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Track Changes: Keep a history of modifications.\n",
    "    Collaborate: Work with multiple people on the same project.\n",
    "    Backup: Maintain copies of your codebase.\n",
    "    Branching and Merging: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduction to Git <a name=\"2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system, which means every developer has a complete history of the project on their local machine. It is fast, scalable, and supports non-linear development through branching and merging.\n",
    "Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Git, follow the instructions on the official Git website.\n",
    "3. Basic Git Commands <a name=\"3\"></a>\n",

    "4. Working with Branches <a name=\"4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches allow you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously. The default branch in Git is called main (or master in older repositories).\n",
    "Creating and Switching Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a new branch: git branch <branch-name>\n",
    "    Switch to a branch: git checkout <branch-name>\n",
    "    Create and switch: git checkout -b <branch-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "To merge changes from one branch into another, use the git merge command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Switch to the branch you want to merge into:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bash\n",
    "\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge the other branch:\n",

    "5. Collaborating with Git <a name=\"5\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a team, Git allows you to collaborate efficiently. Here are some common tasks:\n",
    "Cloning a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working on a project, clone the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",

    "git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing and Pulling Changes\n",

    "    Push changes: git push\n",
    "    Pull changes: git pull\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolving Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts occur when multiple changes are made to the same part of a file. Git will prompt you to resolve conflicts manually before proceeding with a merge.\n",
    "Using Remote Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories allow you to share your work. Common remote operations include:\n",
    "\n",

    "    Commit the changes and merge the branch back into main.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "    The initial commit should include a README.md file.\n",
