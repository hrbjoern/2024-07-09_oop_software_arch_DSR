    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the basics of testing in Python using pytest. Testing is a critical part of developing reliable and maintainable software. By writing tests, we can ensure that our code behaves as expected, prevent bugs from being introduced, and facilitate code refactoring. We'll cover the basic concepts of testing, how to write and run tests with pytest, and how to organize your test code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Testing ensures the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Correctness: Verifies that the code works as intended.\n",
    "    Robustness: Detects edge cases and prevents future bugs.\n",
    "    Maintainability: Facilitates code refactoring and feature addition.\n",

    "\n",
    "pytest is a popular testing framework for Python. It is simple to use, supports fixtures for managing test state, and has powerful plugins for extending its functionality.\n",
    "Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install pytest, use pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Writing Simple Tests <a name=\"3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by writing some simple tests for a hypothetical function in a data science pipeline.\n",
    "Example Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_mean(numbers):\n",
    "    if not numbers:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"The list is empty\")\n",
    "    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file called test_calculate_mean.py:\n",
    "\n",

    "    assert calculate_mean([1, 2, 3]) == 2\n",

    "5. Organizing Tests <a name=\"5\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As your test suite grows, organizing your tests becomes important. Here are some common practices:\n",
    "Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "project/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── src/\n",

    "\n",
    "Using Fixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixtures allow you to set up some state before running your tests. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.fixture\n",
    "def sample_data():\n",
    "    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_calculate_mean_with_fixture(sample_data):\n",
    "    assert calculate_mean(sample_data) == 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixtures are useful for setting up databases, creating temporary files, or preparing any other state that your tests might require.\n",
    "6. Step-by-Step Example <a name=\"6\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now build a more comprehensive example to demonstrate how to write tests using pytest, including the use of fixtures.\n",
    "Step 1: Create the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a function that preprocesses data by normalizing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "def normalize(data):\n",

    "    mean = np.mean(data)\n",
    "    std = np.std(data)\n",

    "Step 3: Running Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, navigate to the directory containing the test file and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see output indicating that the tests have passed or failed, along with details of any failures.\n",
    "Step 4: Adding More Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand the test suite to cover more cases, such as handling non-numeric data or extremely large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",

    "def test_normalize_large_data():\n",
    "    large_data = list(range(1, 10001))\n",
    "    result = normalize(large_data)\n",
    "    mean = np.mean(result)\n",
